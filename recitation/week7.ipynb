    "[Inference rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_inference) are an extremely versatile way to formally define anykind of computation.  In some cases, this extends beyond programming languages.  For example, one can define a specific type of \"constructive logic\" [using inference rules](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15317-f00/handouts/logic.pdf).\n",

    "\n",
    "We often want to use inference rules to reason about a specific program. Each inference rule can only be used for a specific case or type of expression. For example the Plus rule is used only expressions that are a Plus. When we use and inference rule for a specific expression, there are metavariables that need to be instantiated from the expression. The metavariables are essentially blanks that need to be filled in with the specifics of the expression you are using the rule for. When a metavariable occurs multiple times in a rule, each same metavariable spot needs to be filled in with the exact same thing from the expression.\n",
